-- ===================== VIEWS =====================
-- => view is a virtual table whose contents are defined by a query
-- => stored queries that display data from the base tables
-- => views can be queried, updated and joined, just like regular tables

-- Usecases :
-- 1) Simplify Complex Queries (queries with multiple joins etc..)
-- 2) Restrict access only to needed data, rather than the whole data
-- 3) Performance and Readability improvements
-- 4) Mostly used for retriving data rather than manipulating
